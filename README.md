## **Project Overview**

The Hybrid A.U.R.A Assistant is a **voice-controlled AI system** designed to automate PC tasks, perform web automation, generate AI-powered responses, and control smart home devices. Built using Python, Selenium, OpenAI API, and IoT integration, Jarvis can run **continuously in the background**, wake on a **voice command**, and execute tasks intelligently, providing a futuristic assistant experience.

“Problem Statement & Objective” section before the overview:Example:Modern users handle multiple devices and repetitive tasks daily. The AURA Assistant aims to unify PC automation, AI interaction, and IoT control into one intelligent, always-active system.

## **3. Scope of the Project**

1. **Voice Interaction**
    - Recognizes user voice commands.
    - Responds via text-to-speech.
    - Wake-on-voice activation (“Hey Aura”).
2. **System Automation**
    - Open/close applications (Chrome, Notepad, VS Code, etc.).
    - System operations: shutdown, restart, volume/brightness adjustment.
    - Keyboard/mouse automation for tasks.
3. **Web Automation**
    - Google searches and information retrieval.
    - YouTube video search and playback.
    - Gmail automation: open, read, draft emails.
    - WhatsApp Web automation: send messages.
    - General browser automation using Selenium.
4. **AI Integration**
    - Generate intelligent replies, email drafts, and messages via OpenAI API.
    - Understand natural language commands for context-aware actions.
5. **IoT / Home Automation**
    - Control Arduino/ESP8266 connected devices through **Sinric Pro**.
    - Integrate with Alexa for voice-controlled smart home operations.
6. **Background Operation & Daemon Mode**
    - Runs silently in the background.
    - Wake on a voice command without manual start.
    - Convertible into a Windows executable (.exe) using PyInstaller.
